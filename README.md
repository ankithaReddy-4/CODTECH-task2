Name: YENKAMOLLA ANKITHA Company: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS ID:CT08DS3647 Domain:Artificial Intelligence Duration:July-Aug 2024 Mentor: Overview: Model Evaluation and Comparison Objective: The objective of Task 2 is to evaluate and compare the performance of different AI models to determine their effectiveness in solving a particular problem. This involves implementing multiple models, using appropriate evaluation metrics, and analyzing the results to select the best-performing model.

Key Activities: Data Preprocessing:

Objective: Ensure data is clean and suitable for model training. Key Activities: Use the preprocessed data from Task 1. Handle any additional preprocessing if necessary. Implementing Different Models:

Objective: Train and test different AI models on the dataset. Key Activities: Define and initialize multiple models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest). Train each model on the training data. Predicting with the Models:

Objective: Use the trained models to make predictions on the test data. Key Activities: Use each model to predict the labels of the test set. Evaluating Model Performance:

Objective: Assess the effectiveness of each model using appropriate metrics. Key Activities: Calculate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for each model. Comparing Models:

Objective: Identify the best-performing model based on the evaluation metrics. Key Activities: Compile the evaluation metrics into a summary table. Compare the performance of each model using the metrics. Displaying the Results:

Objective: Present the evaluation results in a clear and understandable manner. Key Activities: Print a summary table of the evaluation metrics for each model. Highlight the model with the best overall performance.
